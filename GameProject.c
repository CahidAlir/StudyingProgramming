/**
That's your new project..

Create a game..  Program should generate a number between 1-10.000
Than gives player ten rights to guess.
Your program should say "your number is bigger/smaller than my number"
Program should rate all guess.. The closer guess player did, the much more point that he gets..
I totally leave it to you.. Do whatever you like but just try each guess should be promoted between 1-50

when user find out the number that program generates, than decide:

If player guess the correct number less than 3 times than

+10.000 point and print "Sorry god, I couldn't recognize you!"

between 3-5

+7.500 point and print "Oracle!! Is that you?"

5-7 guesses

+5.000 point and print "Brilliant! You are good at it!"

7-9 guess

+1.000 point and print "Well done boy!"

10 guess 

+200 point and print "You lucky bastard!"

and each case should finish with this statement

"YOUR TOTAL SCORE IS : XXXX"

You can google it if you wonder how a c program generates a number..

Good Luck!
